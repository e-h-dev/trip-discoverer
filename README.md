# About

Trip Discoverer, is an easy to use website, designed for anyone to access. The website provides up to date and 
clear information, for anyone looking for a nice day out. The options range from family to adult to kid friendly places. Users can also sign in and add their own Trips for the benefit of others.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

### Home Page

* The next wireframes cover the same layout. The Register page and Login page share layout, and the New Trip and Edit trip pages share layout. I have therefore, provided one wireframe for each group.
