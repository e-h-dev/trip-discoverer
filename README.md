* The next wireframes cover the same layout. The Register page and Login page share layout, and the New Trip and Edit trip pages share layout. I have therefore, provided one wireframe for each group.

# Bugs

When updating font-size in the navbar the size would not upate from the generic materialize font.
After looking in devtools, I saw the new css fontsize was not working as the original fontsize was on the materalize css as 15px. after updating the class fonts to each of the nav list items the size largened.
